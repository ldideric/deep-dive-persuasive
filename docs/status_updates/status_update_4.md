# Status update day 4

**16-02-2023**

Kian worked on the front-end. He reworked the login page and made some slight changes to other pages.
Thijs has added a new page for the lab scientists to add test results. On this page there is also an excel input to easily add test results very quickly.
Next to that Thijs also did some minor bug fixes.
Lietze created a readme file for the project. This way people can easily get started with the project.
Lietze also added a search by date of birth so GP's can easily find patients.

This will probably the last day we work on the back-end of the project. We will no longer add new features to the back-end.
We will now focus on making the front-end more user friendly and fix any bugs that might occur.
