# Status update day 1

**13-02-2023**

Lietze wrote the summary of the pitch done by the CEO of Persuasive.

We have worked on the project plan for most of the day.
Lietze and Kian have worked mostly on the project plan, and Thijs has worked on the setup of the project.

We're usually not the best at planning and documenting, but we feel like it went pretty well today.

Thijs has worked more on the setup of the project, and has made a lot of progress.
The BitLab repository has been created, with a fresh Laravel installation.

The database has been set up, and has been seeded.
