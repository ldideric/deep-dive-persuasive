# Status update day 3

**15-02-2023**

Lietze has made the patients overview page.
Thijs has made search functionality for the GP's page, to find patients by ID and name.
Kian worked on the frontend of the dashboard for GP's, and has made a lot of progress.

Thijs added a scope for results and patients, so that the GP's can only see their own patients.

We all worked on some minor styling changes, which really improved the look of the website.

The site really came together quite nicely today, and we're really happy with the progress we've made.
