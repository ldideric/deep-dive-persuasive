❤️ Valentines day ❤️

We have worked on a lot of backend today. Thijs and Kian worked on the backend of the results.

Thijs made the two-factor authentication work completely, and has made a lot of progress on the backend of the results.

Thijs has also made some progress on additional backend dependencies for the rest of the site.

Lietze has worked on the frontend of the overview page of the patients.

Today was pretty productive, we have made a lot of progress on the backend side.

Tomorrow we will work on the frontend of multiple pages, making everything more coherent.
